# Third-party notices

Techmech keys INPUT LAB (`TechmechInputLab.exe`) ships with the components
listed here. Their licenses are reproduced in full below, as those licenses
require. This file is copied next to the executable, so a released zip
carries the same notices.

The web UI (`ui/`) contains no third-party code: it is plain HTML/CSS/JS with
no bundled libraries, fonts or images.

The WebView2 **Runtime** is *not* bundled — it is a Microsoft-provided
component already present on Windows 10/11 (or installed separately by the
user), and it is covered by Microsoft's own terms.

| Component | Version | License |
|---|---|---|
| [Microsoft.Web.WebView2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2) (SDK assemblies) | 1.0.2903.40 | BSD 3-Clause style (text below) |
| [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) | 0.38.0 | MIT |
| [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) (bundled by `--self-contained` builds) | 8.0.x | MIT |
